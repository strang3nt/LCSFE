# sem-sfe (Symbolic Exists-Moves for Systems of Fixpoint Equations)

This tool implements a local algorithm for verifying solutions of systems of fixpoint
equations, and it is based on the following articles:

Paolo Baldan, Barbara König, Tommaso Padoan, 2020.
Abstraction, Up-To Techniques and Games for Systems of Fixpoint Equations.
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08877>

Paolo Baldan, Barbara König, Tommaso Padoan, Christina Mika-Michalski
Fixpoint Games on Continuous Lattices
<https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11404>

The user should to be familiar with the following concepts:

- systems of fixpoint equations over complete lattices;
- a game theoretic view of systems of fixpoint equations, called powerset game;
- selections;
- upward-closures and a symbolic representation for upward-closed sets, namely,
  symbolic $\exists$-moves.
