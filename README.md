# sem-sfe (Symbolic Exists-Moves for Systems of Fixpoint Equations)

This tool implements a local algorithm for verifying solutions of systems of fixpoint
equations, and it is based on the following article:

Paolo Baldan, Barbara KÃ¶nig, Tommaso Padoan, 2020.
Abstraction, Up-To Techniques and Games for Systems of Fixpoint Equations.
<https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08877>

The user should to be familiar with the following concepts:

- systems of fixpoint equations, and complete lattices;
- parity games;
- progress measures and selections;
- upwards-closure, and a symbolic representation for upwards closed sets, namely,
  the symbolic exists-moves.
